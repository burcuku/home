<!-- I am an Assistant Professor in the [Software Engineering Research Group (SERG)](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/) at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). <!-- Before that, I was a postdoc researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS), working with [Rupak Majumdar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/). I got my PhD from KoÃ§ University under the supervision of [Serdar Tasiran](https://www.tasiran.org/). -->

As software systems have become ubiquitous, modern applications are designed to be highly concurrent, responsive, fault-tolerant, and distributed. The increased complexity of these systems makes it more challenging to produce correct software.

My research aims to produce rigorous and practical software tools for increasing the reliability of software systems: It brings the advantages of the rigorous approaches of formal methods together with the practical approaches of sofware engineering. To this end, my research spans **formal methods, model checking, software testing**, and **debugging** with a focus on **concurrent and distributed systems**. You can find more in my interview ["Challenges of Concurrency"](https://ict-research.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IO-magazine-NR4-2022_online.pdf) at the I/O Magazine, ICT Platform Nederland.


At TU Delft, I lead and take supervisory role in several research teams and projects:   

- I lead the [FORSE (Lightweight Formal Methods for Software Engineering)](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/research-lines/forse) lab, where my [team](https://burcuku.github.io/home/team) develops automated software analysis techniques for concurrent and distributed systems. Our research has been funded by personal academic research grants from the [Amazon Research Award](https://www.amazon.science/research-awards/recipients/burcu-kulahcioglu-ozkan) and [Stellar Academic Research Grant](https://research.stellar.org/research-grants). 

- I am the co-PI of Ripple's [UBRI program](https://ripple.com/impact/ubri/) at TU Delft together with [Annibale Panichella](https://apanichella.github.io/). Our lab focuses on testing and debugging of blockchain systems and their applications.


- I lead a research track of the [TU Delft - JetBrains collaboration](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/ai4se/), AISE. [Our track](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/ai4se/tracks/04_utilizing_runtime_data.html) aims to utilize the runtime information to improve software development and quality.
