### [CSE2520: Big Data Processing](https://burcuku.github.io/cse2520-bigdata/)
##### TU Delft, 2025/Q1, 2024/Q1, 2023/Q1, 2022/Q1, 2021/Q1, 2020/Q1,

Big Data Processing provides an introduction to systems used to process Big Data. The main focus of the course is understanding the underpinnings of, programming and engineering big data systems; initially, the course explores general programming primitives that span across big data systems and touches upon distributed systems. Then, the course examines in detail the implementation of data analysis algorithms in Spark, in the context of batch processing applications, and Flink, in the context of streaming applications.


### [CS4720 Research in Program Analysis](https://cs4720.github.io/)

##### TU Delft, 2025/Q4
This is a research course which provides an introduction to the field of software analysis, a critical aspect of software development and maintenance.  In this course, we explore various techniques for software analysis, including practical formal methods, model checking, static and dynamic analysis, and other key approaches to evaluating and improving software systems. Through hands-on project, you will gain experience understanding and applying these techniques and presenting them using a scientific valid methodology.


### [CS4405 Analysis of Concurrent and Distributed Programs](https://cs4405.github.io/)

##### TU Delft, 2024/Q3, 2023/Q3, 2022/Q3
Software systems are becoming highly concurrent and distributed to utilize modern multicore architectures and increasing speed and bandwidth in networks. Shared-memory concurrency in multicore programs and message-passing concurrency in distributed programs share many common abstractions and problems. This course aims to explore analysis techniques for concurrent and distributed programs.
